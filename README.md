#  Operating System Notes and Concepts

Welcome to my **Operating System (OS)** learning repository!

This repository is a personal knowledge base where I document everything I'm learning about Operating Systems ‚Äî from the absolute basics to advanced concepts.  
Each topic is explained in a beginner-friendly way, using **simple English (sometimes Hinglish)**, **real-life analogies**, and **visuals** to make learning easier and more enjoyable.

##  Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **track my OS learning journey from scratch** and to build a solid understanding of how operating systems work behind the scenes.  
These notes are not only for myself but also for anyone looking for clear, structured, and easy-to-understand OS explanations.
